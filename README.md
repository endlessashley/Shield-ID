# Shield-ID

# Description
An interactive web app that dynamically delivers key information about Marvel superheroes to the user

# Motivation
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is one of the most popular, highest grossing cinema and TV franchises. But this expansive universe, filled with hundreds of characters based on decades of comic books, can be difficult for the uninitiated to enter. This app seeks to solve that problem by offering users a quick, easy way to access character overviews. It is styled in the manner of a S.H.I.E.L.D. dossier, since S.H.I.E.L.D. is Marvel’s government agency established to oversee superheroes and identify villains and threats.

# User Story
AS a user
GIVEN that I want to quick access information about characters in the MCU
WHEN I navigate to the website
THEN I am presented with an interface styled in the manner of a classified government document.
WHEN I type a character’s name into the search bar
THEN I am presented with a thumbnail of that character and a profile including their name, aliases, bio, occupation, stats, and their first appearance in the comic books. I am also presented with “action shots” comprised of GIFs from the films. 
WHEN I have searched a character
THEN my search results are saved as buttons that I can click to re-search for that character.
WHEN I navigate away from and then return to the page
THEN the page is already populated with results from my most recent previous search.

# Acceptance Criteria

Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data.
Application doesn't use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead).
